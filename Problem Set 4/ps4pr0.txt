PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
Actually I do not look forward to ​Kurzweil’s vision of the future. He thinks that people can live forever, and computers gain consciousness, which sounds like men and machines became similar. The characteristics of humans, such as emotions, are reducing, and robots become more and more like humans. But if people will not die just like robots, and everything could be achieved by artificial intelligence, people will feel that life is meaningless. It’s also possible that artificial intelligence with consciousness will overtake us and cause the catastrophe of humans. Moreover, I do not completely believe Kurzweil’s prediction, because I think it contains occasionality and is too subjective. Although he takes some data, it does not always work because no one can truly predict the future. It is just based on his hypothesis and his belief in modern technology.
