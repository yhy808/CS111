I choose the excerpts of Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World and Thoreau’s Walden as two source bodies. The text of Brave New World is more about technology and human behavior in an advanced society. Walden talks more about nature and landscape. I choose the other four novels to compare with these two source bodies, which are Orwell’s 1984, Maugham’s The Moon and Sixpence, Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, and Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea. According to the result of my text classification program, 1984, The Moon and Sixpence and Wuthering Heights are more like Brave New World. The Old Man and the Sea is more like Walden. 


The result is mostly the same with my hypothesis as I suppose that 1984 is similar to Brave New World and The Old Man and the Sea is similar to Walden, while I’m not very sure about the other two. I think the program could be further improved in judging the tone of words by classifying their semantic meanings, which would be applied more extensively than just comparing the appearance of the same words. Also, the program will be more accurate if it can analyze the composition and structure of the sentences, like the order of subject, verb, and object, which may reflect the language habits of the author.
